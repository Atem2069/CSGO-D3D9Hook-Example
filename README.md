# CSGO-D3D9Hook-Example
Short example of basic VMT hooking in CSGO.

This method will NOT work with the dummy device method of obtaining a D3D device. In order to do that, you will need a hooking library that supports detours or trampoline hooks.

Project requires DirectX SDK to be built (depends on D3DX9), and also does not come with an injector.
